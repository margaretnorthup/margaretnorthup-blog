# Welcome to My Blog

Hi, I’m Margaret. This is my space for sharing thoughts, stories, and helpful ideas as I reboot my journey toward independence and peace.

## My First Post: Getting Unstuck

Today I’m launching this blog as a small first step. If you’re feeling stuck, know you’re not alone. Sometimes, just starting—even if imperfect—creates momentum.

Stay tuned for updates, resources, and honest stories.
